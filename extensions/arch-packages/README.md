# Arch Packages

Currently has one command to search for Arch and AUR packages.

TODO:

- [ ] - allow picking package manager in preferences
- [ ] - show installed status
- [ ] - (maybe) allow installing packages

## Dev

You can install the required dependencies and run your extension in development mode like so:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

If you want to build the production bundle, simply run:

```bash
npm run build
```
