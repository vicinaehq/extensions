# raycast-compat

Everything related to tracking Vicinae Raycast extension compatibility.

We maintain a global json mapping `compat.json` that lists every Raycast extension and their associated test status.

This list is used as a base to know what needs to be tested, and also provide guidance to store users as to what extensions work or not (note: still needs implementation on the vicinae side at this time).

At a later point in time, we might provide patches for most popular extensions and provide the users with patched versions. There is no well defined plan as to how we will do this at this time.
